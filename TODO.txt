To do 
see if it is possible to use a state to hide the the section at the top with the game selectors in it after the game starts and then not show it again untill after the page reloads - so that while user is playing only the section at bottom to play again shows. 

do something with the footer. 

add something on the side that opens on over to selected the db version of the game 


back end - 
set up db structure to match the api call seed file created, add a few more with CCRN or CSCS category 
seed db with quiz - ask a TA how to seed  and  move DB with data to heroku 

add ability to play game from the DB 

User authentiction 
look at  auth o    https://auth0.com/blog/reactjs-authentication-tutorial/
add bootstrap authentiation front end
passport on back end 
user table in the db 


look at this Lynda.com 
https://www.lynda.com/React-Native-tutorials/Working-timers/560343/672443-4.html

The week 6 game has a loadQuestion function  that puts the timer with countdown on the page with the question.   
nextQuestion funcion restarts the timer at 30 seconds  and loads the next question on the page 
the timeup function clears the timer shows corect answer, tracks in the un answered tally , waits 3 seconds then goes to resutls screen if last question or on th the next question with the timer set back to 30 seconds

In the new game - 
still to do when the quiz is over the display goes back to 30 and runs down while waiting for next quiz.  need to stop it, display scores and then re start with next quiz. 



if that works add a database seeded with some additionnal questions and answers and create form for user input.  store in same format as api

if all that works add front end bootstrap user authentication 

if that all works add pasport user auth
