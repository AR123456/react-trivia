To do 
Get timers working 
look at this Lynda.com 
https://www.lynda.com/React-Native-tutorials/Working-timers/560343/672443-4.html

The week 6 game has a loadQuestion function  that puts the timer with countdown on the page with the question.   
nextQuestion funcion restarts the timer at 30 seconds  and loads the next question on the page 
the timeup function clears the timer shows corect answer, tracks in the un answered tally , waits 3 seconds then goes to resutls screen if last question or on th the next question with the timer set back to 30 seconds

In the new game - 
still to do when the quiz is over the display goes back to 30 and runs down while waiting for next quiz.  need to stop it, display scores and then re start with next quiz.
